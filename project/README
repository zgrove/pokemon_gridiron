TEXT-BASED POKEMON

This project will provide a text-based Pokemon game where the user
can battle with certain Pokemon and catch wild Pokemon. We will use
the string-parsing strategies learned over the semester, such as using
grep, sed, and read, to calculate damage done in battle or the catch
rate of a wild Pokemon. In addition, we will follow the rules of the
Unix philosophy, such as the rule of modularity and the rule of simplicity,
to write a simple template that can be used to represent any Pokemon and a
script to simulate a battle.
